I am currently pursuing a PhD in Soil and Crop Sciences with a minor in Computer Science at Cornell University. My journey into precision agriculture and data science is fueled by a passion for solving real-world agricultural challenges through cutting-edge technologies. With extensive experience in drone-based monitoring, herbicide resistance detection, deep learning algorithms, and geospatial analysis, I am committed to optimizing agricultural productivity while promoting sustainable farming practices.

My work bridges the fields of AI, remote sensing, robotics, and integrated weed management, focusing on challenges like identifying herbicide-resistant weeds and improving crop health monitoring through computer vision. I am particularly interested in multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, detection algorithms like YOLO, and machine learning applications for plant phenotyping.

Having a multidisciplinary background—ranging from electrical engineering to biological engineering—has enabled me to integrate different technological solutions to advance smart agriculture practices. Beyond technical expertise, I enjoy collaborating with farmers and industry professionals to translate research into practical, actionable solutions.
